# Obsidian community plugin

## Project overview

- Target: Obsidian Community Plugin (TypeScript → bundled JavaScript).
- Entry point: `main.ts` compiled to `main.js` and loaded by Obsidian.
- Required release artifacts: `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and optional `styles.css`.

## Environment & tooling

- Node.js: use current LTS (Node 18+ recommended).
- **Package manager: npm** (required for this sample - `package.json` defines npm scripts and dependencies).
- **Bundler: esbuild** (required for this sample - `esbuild.config.mjs` and build scripts depend on it). Alternative bundlers like Rollup or webpack are acceptable for other projects if they bundle all external dependencies into `main.js`.
- Types: `obsidian` type definitions.

**Note**: This sample project has specific technical dependencies on npm and esbuild. If you're creating a plugin from scratch, you can choose different tools, but you'll need to replace the build configuration accordingly.

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Dev (watch)

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Linting

- To use eslint install eslint from terminal: `npm install -g eslint`
- To use eslint to analyze this project use this command: `eslint main.ts`
- eslint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
- If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use eslint with this command to analyze all files in that folder: `eslint ./src/`

## File & folder conventions

- **Organize code into multiple files**: Split functionality across separate modules rather than putting everything in `main.ts`.
- Source lives in `src/`. Keep `main.ts` small and focused on plugin lifecycle (loading, unloading, registering commands).
- **Example file structure**:
  ```
  src/
    main.ts           # Plugin entry point, lifecycle management
    settings.ts       # Settings interface and defaults
    commands/         # Command implementations
      command1.ts
      command2.ts
    ui/              # UI components, modals, views
      modal.ts
      view.ts
    utils/           # Utility functions, helpers
      helpers.ts
      constants.ts
    types.ts         # TypeScript interfaces and types
  ```
- **Do not commit build artifacts**: Never commit `node_modules/`, `main.js`, or other generated files to version control.
- Keep the plugin small. Avoid large dependencies. Prefer browser-compatible packages.
- Generated output should be placed at the plugin root or `dist/` depending on your build setup. Release artifacts must end up at the top level of the plugin folder in the vault (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`).

## Manifest rules (`manifest.json`)

- Must include (non-exhaustive):  
  - `id` (plugin ID; for local dev it should match the folder name)  
  - `name`  
  - `version` (Semantic Versioning `x.y.z`)  
  - `minAppVersion`  
  - `description`  
  - `isDesktopOnly` (boolean)  
  - Optional: `author`, `authorUrl`, `fundingUrl` (string or map)
- Never change `id` after release. Treat it as stable API.
- Keep `minAppVersion` accurate when using newer APIs.
- Canonical requirements are coded here: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/.github/workflows/validate-plugin-entry.yml

## Testing

- Manual install for testing: copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` (if any) to:
  ```
  <Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-id>/
  ```
- Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings → Community plugins**.

## Commands & settings

- Any user-facing commands should be added via `this.addCommand(...)`.
- If the plugin has configuration, provide a settings tab and sensible defaults.
- Persist settings using `this.loadData()` / `this.saveData()`.
- Use stable command IDs; avoid renaming once released.

## Versioning & releases

- Bump `version` in `manifest.json` (SemVer) and update `versions.json` to map plugin version → minimum app version.
- Create a GitHub release whose tag exactly matches `manifest.json`'s `version`. Do not use a leading `v`.
- Attach `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `styles.css` (if present) to the release as individual assets.
- After the initial release, follow the process to add/update your plugin in the community catalog as required.

## Security, privacy, and compliance

Follow Obsidian's **Developer Policies** and **Plugin Guidelines**. In particular:

- Default to local/offline operation. Only make network requests when essential to the feature.
- No hidden telemetry. If you collect optional analytics or call third-party services, require explicit opt-in and document clearly in `README.md` and in settings.
- Never execute remote code, fetch and eval scripts, or auto-update plugin code outside of normal releases.
- Minimize scope: read/write only what's necessary inside the vault. Do not access files outside the vault.
- Clearly disclose any external services used, data sent, and risks.
- Respect user privacy. Do not collect vault contents, filenames, or personal information unless absolutely necessary and explicitly consented.
- Avoid deceptive patterns, ads, or spammy notifications.
- Register and clean up all DOM, app, and interval listeners using the provided `register*` helpers so the plugin unloads safely.

## UX & copy guidelines (for UI text, commands, settings)

- Prefer sentence case for headings, buttons, and titles.
- Use clear, action-oriented imperatives in step-by-step copy.
- Use **bold** to indicate literal UI labels. Prefer "select" for interactions.
- Use arrow notation for navigation: **Settings → Community plugins**.
- Keep in-app strings short, consistent, and free of jargon.

## Performance

- Keep startup light. Defer heavy work until needed.
- Avoid long-running tasks during `onload`; use lazy initialization.
- Batch disk access and avoid excessive vault scans.
- Debounce/throttle expensive operations in response to file system events.

## Coding conventions

- TypeScript with `"strict": true` preferred.
- **Keep `main.ts` minimal**: Focus only on plugin lifecycle (onload, onunload, addCommand calls). Delegate all feature logic to separate modules.
- **Split large files**: If any file exceeds ~200-300 lines, consider breaking it into smaller, focused modules.
- **Use clear module boundaries**: Each file should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- Bundle everything into `main.js` (no unbundled runtime deps).
- Avoid Node/Electron APIs if you want mobile compatibility; set `isDesktopOnly` accordingly.
- Prefer `async/await` over promise chains; handle errors gracefully.

## Mobile

- Where feasible, test on iOS and Android.
- Don't assume desktop-only behavior unless `isDesktopOnly` is `true`.
- Avoid large in-memory structures; be mindful of memory and storage constraints.

## Agent do/don't

**Do**
- Add commands with stable IDs (don't rename once released).
- Provide defaults and validation in settings.
- Write idempotent code paths so reload/unload doesn't leak listeners or intervals.
- Use `this.register*` helpers for everything that needs cleanup.

**Don't**
- Introduce network calls without an obvious user-facing reason and documentation.
- Ship features that require cloud services without clear disclosure and explicit opt-in.
- Store or transmit vault contents unless essential and consented.

## Common tasks

### Organize code across multiple files

**main.ts** (minimal, lifecycle only):
```ts
import { Plugin } from "obsidian";
import { MySettings, DEFAULT_SETTINGS } from "./settings";
import { registerCommands } from "./commands";

export default class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
  settings: MySettings;

  async onload() {
    this.settings = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_SETTINGS, await this.loadData());
    registerCommands(this);
  }
}
```

**settings.ts**:
```ts
export interface MySettings {
  enabled: boolean;
  apiKey: string;
}

export const DEFAULT_SETTINGS: MySettings = {
  enabled: true,
  apiKey: "",
};
```

**commands/index.ts**:
```ts
import { Plugin } from "obsidian";
import { doSomething } from "./my-command";

export function registerCommands(plugin: Plugin) {
  plugin.addCommand({
    id: "do-something",
    name: "Do something",
    callback: () => doSomething(plugin),
  });
}
```

### Add a command

```ts
this.addCommand({
  id: "your-command-id",
  name: "Do the thing",
  callback: () => this.doTheThing(),
});
```

### Persist settings

```ts
interface MySettings { enabled: boolean }
const DEFAULT_SETTINGS: MySettings = { enabled: true };

async onload() {
  this.settings = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_SETTINGS, await this.loadData());
  await this.saveData(this.settings);
}
```

### Register listeners safely

```ts
this.registerEvent(this.app.workspace.on("file-open", f => { /* ... */ }));
this.registerDomEvent(window, "resize", () => { /* ... */ });
this.registerInterval(window.setInterval(() => { /* ... */ }, 1000));
```

## Troubleshooting

- Plugin doesn't load after build: ensure `main.js` and `manifest.json` are at the top level of the plugin folder under `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-id>/`. 
- Build issues: if `main.js` is missing, run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` to compile your TypeScript source code.
- Commands not appearing: verify `addCommand` runs after `onload` and IDs are unique.
- Settings not persisting: ensure `loadData`/`saveData` are awaited and you re-render the UI after changes.
- Mobile-only issues: confirm you're not using desktop-only APIs; check `isDesktopOnly` and adjust.

## Intent of Code
This plugin exists to keep numbers accurate and automatic in trade notes, to make dashboards fast and trustworthy, and to free your daily journals for clarity, intent, and learning—where your edge is built.
### Purpose

  - Transform trading notes into the single source of truth, reduce manual bookkeeping, and make daily journaling a thinking tool.
  - Capture atomic fills in a stable schema; compute and persist metrics automatically; render dashboards from persisted data.

### Context

  - Vault structure follows ACE (Atlas, Calendar, Efforts). Trading lives in Efforts/Ongoing/Trading/.
  - Manual YAML (“status”, “win”, “avg_exit”) and table parsing were brittle and tedious—especially on mobile.
  - We moved fills to frontmatter (schema v2), derived metrics from fills, and automated persistence via scripts and now a plugin.

### Core Model

  - Single source of truth: fills[] in frontmatter (each fill = { side, t, base, quote, price, note?, txs? }).
  - Derived metrics (persisted): metrics object in frontmatter { status, position, avg_entry, avg_exit, realized_pnl, r_multiple, win, last_fill_at, computed_at }.
  - Design principle: no duplicated numbers; dashboards and notes read persisted metrics; daily journals focus on intent/learning.

### How We Got Here

  - Initial state: per-trade tables + manual fields (status, win, averages).
  - Step 1: Move to YAML fills[]; compute metrics in DataviewJS for display-only.
  - Step 2: Add QuickAdd user scripts (New Trade v2, Add Fill, Close Trade) + Buttons for mobile; compute metrics on write.
  - Step 3: DRY shared logic (common.js, trade-metrics.js), add recompute (single/bulk), and have dashboard read persisted metrics (no dv.view return hacks).
  - Step 4: Draft a minimal Obsidian plugin; then port to TypeScript with settings for root, filename pattern, and body template.

### What The Plugin Does

  - Commands:
      - New Trade: creates a trade note with v2 schema and an initial fill; appends a body via template; persists metrics.
      - Add Trade Fill: appends an in/out fill with sign guardrails; persists metrics.
      - Close Trade: flattens position via out fill (price or quote mode with guardrails), sets closed_at, persists metrics.
      - Recompute Trade Metrics (one): updates metrics from fills in the current/picked trade.
      - Bulk Recompute Trade Metrics (folder): recomputes for all schema v2 trades in a folder (e.g., year).
  - Settings:
      - tradesRoot (default Efforts/Ongoing/Trading/Trades)
      - filenamePattern (e.g., T-${YYYY}${MM}${DD}-${HH}${mm}-${PAIR}-${ACTION})
      - bodyTemplatePath (default utils/templates/trading/trade-body.md)
  - Defaults:
      - If the body template is missing, new trades include two Buttons (Add Fill/Close Trade) and Dataview views for metrics/fills rendering.

### Why Persist Metrics

  - Reliable dashboards without relying on dv.view return values.
  - Mobile/read-only contexts are fast; no recompute needed to browse.
  - Stale detection: dashboard flags rows stale if a fill is newer than metrics.last_fill_at.

### Daily Journals’ Role

  - Not for bookkeeping. Capture:
      - Intent (bias, if–then, invalidations, risk for the day)
      - Market context and plays (triggers, exits, position sizing)
      - During-session notes (observations vs plan)
      - Post-session reflections (top 3, lessons, process changes)
  - Link to trades via Dataview; let trade notes carry the numbers.

### Key Design Choices

  - Schema v2 in frontmatter; tables are optional, not canonical.
  - Guardrails normalize quote signs per action/side; time prompts prefilled for quick edits.
  - Buttons and Commands provide mobile-friendly input.
  - Dashboard reads persisted metrics; DataviewJS renders per-note metrics/tables for readability.

###  Future Enhancements

  - Validation UI or schema customization (user-defined extra frontmatter).
  - Event-driven recompute on save (opt-in), lint/compliance checks, richer settings.
  - Modularize TS source further (metrics/fills/utils) and add light tests.
  - “Flatten now” command (one-tap close), and richer analytics/filters on dashboard.
